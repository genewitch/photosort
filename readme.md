If you've used that **CLIP** python CLI tool 
to export a **CSV** for a directory of images

This program, as it stands unedited, will, upon clicking load CSV, assuming 
the CSV is *in the same folder* as all of the images referenced by the CSV, 
display, with a two second delay, in order, each image referenced in the CSV, 
and the "prompt" value from the CSV in the textbox.

it should also hide the load CSV button.

I am unsure if i will be adding any more features. obviously this is a quick 
slideshow to *laugh* and ponder the essense of **CLIP**
